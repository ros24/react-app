# React hooks

- Normal js utils functions written by react developers
- ex- useState() - used to create a state varible in react. Whenever a state variable changes, react re render the component.
- React uses reconciliation algorithms also called React fiber.
  There is actual DOM present for every tag in the html like our res-cotainer div
  React creates a virtual DOM(representation of a actual DOM) for our container (its basically a normal js object)
  so Diff algorithms finds the diff b/w old and new virtual DOMs and then update the DOM with the new data with eveny render.
  so basically its not toching the actual DOM, also these algo work on js objects so reacts is very fast.
  It can do efficient DOM manupulation
